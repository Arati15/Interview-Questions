    1. Write an algorithm to determine if a linkedlist is a palindrome
    
    2. Write an algorithm to determine if a linkedlist is circular. FOLLOW UP: Determine where the circle meets.
    
    3. Clone a linked list with a random pointer.
    
    4. Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. Follow up: How would you solve it if temporary buffer is not allowed?
    
    5. Implement an algorithm to find the kth to the last element of a singly linked list
    
    6. Implement an algorithm to delete a node a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
   
   7.  Write code to partition a linkedlist around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes great than or equal to x. 
    
    8. Reverse a linked list â€“ iteratively and recursively

    9. Given a singly linked list which has data sorted in ascending order, construct a balanced BST.
